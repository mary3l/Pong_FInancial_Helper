// Savings goals, the way GoTyme GoalSave works: each goal is its own pocket
// with a target and a deadline, interest is worked out every day on the
// day's end balance (rate ÷ 365), and the month's interest is added on the
// 1st after the 20% tax. Auto-save puts money in every day, week or month.
// Here each goal is a wallet with a target, so MariBank (interest added
// daily) and plain savings work the same way.
